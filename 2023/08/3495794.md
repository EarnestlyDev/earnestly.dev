After launching Pithy Panda traffic to my Etsy store has been ... I think a few people have seen it. They're still considering what to buy I'm sure. 

I knew that I'd need to learn some things about SEO in order for this to do anything, this just confirms that. I've come up a little short when thinking of what I can write/create online to help generate traffic for people searching for t-shirts. I'm sure it can be done, I'm just not sure where to start.

More obvious to me is creating content about something that people are interested in reading about. One of the first things I considered when planning out Earnestly was a newsletter/blog about hiking. I did some research into the state of similar blogs, and mapped out a fair amount of content, did some design work, created a logo, bought a domain, but then decided that it wasn't the right thing to focus on at the time. If you've been reading along here you've seen everything I've thought about since that point.

Faced now with a need to learn something about SEO, I'm circling back to **HikeTN**. I've been getting back up to speed the past few days on what I'd started there, and plan to have something up and running soon. Unlike t-shirts, I have a lot to say about hiking so should be able to learn a lot about SEO. Hopefully things that'll I'll be able to apply in some way to selling t-shirts.
