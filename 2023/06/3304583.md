Days 23-27/30: I've had a bit of a slow spot in this 30 day challenge - just too many other things going on. Regardless ... 

I was able to do a little debugging of the issue between Make and Shippo and open a ticket with Shippo after verifying the API request/response from Make. Turns out there's a bug in the API, they suggested an alternate endpoint as a workaround (the one I was using is still in beta). 

I think I'm just about at the point of making a final punchlist before calling this ready.
