Day 20/30: it's possible that I've overcomplicated the schema in my Airtable. I think I've undone a few degrees of complexity - still need to rethink what that means for what I can use on Softr. 

I mostly like no-code, but sometimes it seems like it'd be easier if I wasn't bound by its constraints.
